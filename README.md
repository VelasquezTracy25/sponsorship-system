# Simple Sponsorship System

This system will accept a form submission for new leagues and write them to a MySQL database.

It will also submit a form to sponsor leagues, taking in coordinates, a radius, and a budget amount to calculate the max amount of teams an organization can sponsor.

## Installation

This project uses Spring Boot Framework to produce frontend forms on http://localhost:8080/.
